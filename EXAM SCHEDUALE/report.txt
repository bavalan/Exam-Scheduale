I added an extra search box and search button that allows the user to search by instructor name with the desired search option of course code. I added two files myexamsb.js and examsb.php that is responsible for the search engine for instructor name. User must use mouse to press the desired buttons instead of the “Enter key”. If user decides to use the ”Enter key” one must press the “Tab key” to highlight the desired button
